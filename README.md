# Ticketmaster App Clone

An Android application that lets users discover and save local events using the [Ticketmaster API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/).

The UI is built using **Androidâ€™s native view system**, with dynamic event cards and an interactive map.
